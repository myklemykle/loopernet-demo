# Loopernet demo

Work very much in progress. Known issues:

* On initial unmute, if already playing, there can be an audio glitch. WIP.
* I still see sound get out of sync after reload on iOS; closing the window completely & reopening seems to fix it. Hmmm.
* Time stutters when BPM is changed. WIP.
